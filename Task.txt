Bubbles (Problem 2.exe)

The camera is fixed looking at the center of the green boundary square 
from a perpendicular position. There is red circle inside the square.
After the program starts, five bubbles will pop up one by one from the
left bottom region of the square and start moving towards a random 
direction. None of the bubbles will go out of the boundary square. Rather, 
they will be reflected upon colliding with the boundary of the square. 
Note that, the bubbles that haven’t yet gone inside the red circle will 
cross one another.

When a bubble goes completely inside the red circle, it will never go out
of the circle. Rather, it will reflect upon colliding with the circle. It
will also reflect with other bubbles that are completely inside the red 
circle. Note that, the bubble will not reflect with bubbles that are outside
the red circle even partially.


The program will also support the following functionalities.
Up arrow – increase the speed of the bubbles
Down arrow – decrease the speed of the bubbles
Press ‘p’ – resume/pause the movement of the bubbles

There should be an upper and lower bound for the speed of the bubbles so that
the speed can’t be increased to ∞ and decreased to 0.
The length of the square and the radius of the circle and bubbles are not 
strictly specified. Adjust the values in order to reproduce the given figure as close as possible.
The bubbles have the same velocity.


Hint:
Maintain two global variables for each bubble to indicate its position and speed.
In the idle function, update the position of the bubbles by adding to them the 
respective speed vectors. Check whether a bubble intersects the boundary square.
If yes, reflect its direction vector on the boundary square. You may want to choose
the sides of the square wisely so that reflection is easier. For example, reflection
against 𝑥 𝑎𝑥𝑖𝑠 in a 2d plane can be done by simply reversing the 𝑦 component of the 
velocity of the bubble.
Check whether a bubble comes completely inside the circle. It can be done by calculating
the distance between the centers of the bubble and the red circle. The bubble is inside
the circle if the distance is ≤ radius of the circle – radius of the bubble.
You have to reflect bubbles with respect to one another and also with respect to the 
red circle. You can follow https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/13261/how-to-get-a-reflection-vector
to find the formula. Please try to understand anything before applying in the assignment.
